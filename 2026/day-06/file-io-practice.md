Today I learned about the file system how to make a diretory and add lines to the file 

commandsi used to make that are 
1. ls - i first list the directories in my system
2. pwd - i check in which directory i was
3. cd - i change the directory to another directory where i am practicing my commands
4. touch - then i made a txt file whre i performed the task
5. echo - i used this command to write my printing line in the txt file
6. cat - used cat to read the txt file
7. head -n 2 - used for printing the top 2 line of my txt file
8. tail -n 2 - used for printing the last 2 line of my txt file


Below is my output:<br></br>
